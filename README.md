### HR ATTRITION CLASS PROJECT

## COMPNAY HUMAN RESOURCE ATTRITION 

### ABSTRACT

**This data analysis project focuses on understanding and forecasting employee attrition within a company. Employee attrition, or 
the rate of employee turnover, can have significant financial and operational impacts, making it crucial for companies to identify
and address its root causes. This project aims to analyze various employee-related data to uncover key drivers of attrition and 
predict future turnover trends.**

**Using historical workforce data—including demographics, job roles, tenure, salary, and exit interview responses—the analysis will 
employ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to identify patterns associated with attrition.
Power BI model will be used to narrow down the analysis reports.**

**The findings will highlight critical factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction, compensation, and career progression
opportunities. The project will also provide actionable recommendations to help reduce turnover, improve employee retention, and 
optimize talent management. Ultimately, this analysis aims to equip the company with data-driven insights to foster a stable, engaged, 
and productive workforce.**
