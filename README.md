### HR ATTRITION CLASS PROJECT

##  HUMAN RESOURCES INCUBATOR HUB ATTRITION CLASS PROJECT

### ABSTRACT

**This data analysis project focuses on understanding and forecasting employee attrition within a company. Employee attrition, or 
the rate of employee turnover, can have significant financial and operational impacts, making it crucial for companies to identify
and address its root causes. This project aims to analyze various employee-related data to uncover key drivers of attrition and 
predict future turnover trends.**

**Using historical workforce data—including demographics, job roles, tenure, salary, and exit interview responses—the analysis will 
employ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to identify patterns associated with attrition.
Power BI model will be used to narrow down the analysis reports.**

**The findings will highlight critical factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction, compensation, and career progression
opportunities. The project will also provide actionable recommendations to help reduce turnover, improve employee retention, and 
optimize talent management. Ultimately, this analysis aims to equip the company with data-driven insights to foster a stable, engaged, 
and productive workforce.**

## INTRODUCTION 

**Employee attrition, or the rate at which employees leave a company, is a critical metric for businesses. High attrition rates can signal 
issues within an organization, such as employee dissatisfaction, lack of career growth opportunities, or inadequate compensation. 
Understanding and addressing the factors driving attrition can help a company retain its talent, reduce recruitment and training costs, 
and maintain a productive workforce.**

## OBJECTIVE 

**The purpose of this data analysis report is to project employee attrition by examining patterns and trends within the company's workforce data. 
Through this analysis, we aim to identify factors contributing to attrition, predict future attrition rates, and suggest actionable recommendations 
to mitigate high turnover.**

**The analysis involves reviewing historical employee data, such as:**

* **Demographics: Age, gender, marital status,  etc.**

* **Employment Factors: **Department, tenure, salary, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and career growth opportunities.**

* **Exit Interviews and Surveys: **Insights into reasons for leaving, feedback on company culture, and employee engagement.**


## METHOODLOGY

**In analyzing the HR data for the Incubator Hub, we can derive insights and recommendations based on the attrition rate 
and other related metrics. Here’s a structured breakdown of the insights and recommendations from the provided data:**

## HUMAN RESOURCE DATA ANALYSIS SUMMARY

* **Total Employees: 1,470**

* **Current Employees: 1,233**

* **Total Attrition: 237**

* **Attrition Rate: 16.2%**

* **Average Age of Current Employees: 37 years**


## INSIGHT

1. **ATTRITION RATE**:

**An attrition rate of 16.2% is significant, indicating that over one in six employees leaves the organization within a year.
This is higher than the average turnover rate across industries, which is typically around 10-15%. High attrition can lead 
to increased recruitment and training costs, and it may affect team morale and productivity.**



2. **CURRENT EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHICS:**

**The average age of current employees is 37, which may suggest a workforce that is relatively experienced. However, it may also 
imply potential future attrition as older employees approach retirement age. Understanding the distribution of age within the 
workforce can be critical for succession planning.***


3. **IMPACT ON TEAMS DYNAMICS:**

**With a considerable number of employees leaving, there could be disruptions in team dynamics, knowledge transfer, and project
continuity. High turnover may lead to increased workloads for remaining staff, which can further contribute to attrition.**



4. ** ROOT CAUSES OF ATTRITION**R

**It is essential to investigate the reasons behind the 237 departures. Factors may include job satisfaction, work-life balance, 
career advancement opportunities, compensation, and workplace culture.**

## INSIGHT BASED ON THE ATTRITION CF AGE BAND BY GENDER

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d5c1958-b506-4ba2-a74d-8d7505b2fa2d)

For analyzing attrition by age and gender, I'll break down some insights and recommendations based on the data provided in the above table;

### INSIGHTS

* . **HIGHER ATTRITION IN THE 25-34 AGE GROUP**

**This group shows the highest attrition for both males and females (43 females and 69 males) amounting to 47% of total attrition. This could indicate a 
trend where employees in this age range are likely seeking new opportunities, either for career advancement, higher compensation, or work-life balance**.

**Individuals in this age range are often early to mid-career, where career progression and growth are essential**.

* **LOWER ATTRITION IN OLDER AGE GROUPS** 

**Attrition decreases significantly after age 35, with the lowest levels seen in employees over 55. This could reflect a greater level of job satisfaction, 
stability, or fewer job market options for older employees**.

**Employees over 55 may be close to retirement, making them less likely to seek new roles and more likely to stay for benefits like retirement plans**.


* **GENDER TRENDS IN ATTRITION**

**Males have a higher attrition rate in every age group, with the largest discrepancy in the 25-34 range. This might indicate a gendered aspect of job 
movement or external factors affecting male employees’ career choices**.

**Females have relatively stable attrition rates across age groups, though they peak in the 25-34 group as well**.






## RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE AGE GROUP ATTRITION 

* ** Targeted Retention Efforts for 25-34 Age Group**:

**Consider creating development programs specifically for employees in this age range, such as mentorship, leadership training, or skills development 
initiatives. These can help meet their growth and career progression needs**.

**Introduce flexible benefits, such as remote work or additional time off, which might appeal to younger employees**.

* **FOCUS ON WORK_LIFE BALANCE INITIATIVES**  

**Work-life balance is often a key factor for attrition among younger employees. Enhancing policies that promote work-life balance, 
such as flexible hours or hybrid work models, could help retain talent, especially females in the 25-34 age group**


* **GENDER-specific insights**
  
**Analyze exit interviews (if available) to uncover specific reasons for male attrition, particularly in the 25-34 age range. 
These insights can help tailor retention strategies, whether it’s compensation adjustments, role clarity, or career advancement**.

**For female employees, consider expanding support systems for balancing personal and professional life, as women in younger age 
groups may face unique challenges related to family or caregiving**.

* **IMPLEMENT ENGAGE SURVEYS**

**Conduct regular employee engagement surveys segmented by age and gender to proactively identify factors leading to attrition. 
This will allow the organization to address issues before they lead to employee exits**.

* **LEVERAGE DATA FOR PREDICTIVE ATTRITION MODELLING**  

**Use historical attrition data and additional factors (e.g., department, years in position) to create a predictive model. 
This can provide early warnings for potential high-risk employees, allowing HR to intervene with targeted retention strategies**.
