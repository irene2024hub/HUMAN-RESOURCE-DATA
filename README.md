### HR ATTRITION CLASS PROJECT

## COMPNAY HUMAN RESOURCE ATTRITION 

### ABSTRACT

**This data analysis project focuses on understanding and forecasting employee attrition within a company. Employee attrition, or 
the rate of employee turnover, can have significant financial and operational impacts, making it crucial for companies to identify
and address its root causes. This project aims to analyze various employee-related data to uncover key drivers of attrition and 
predict future turnover trends.**

**Using historical workforce data—including demographics, job roles, tenure, salary, and exit interview responses—the analysis will 
employ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to identify patterns associated with attrition.
Power BI model will be used to narrow down the analysis reports.**

**The findings will highlight critical factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction, compensation, and career progression
opportunities. The project will also provide actionable recommendations to help reduce turnover, improve employee retention, and 
optimize talent management. Ultimately, this analysis aims to equip the company with data-driven insights to foster a stable, engaged, 
and productive workforce.**

## INTRODUCTION ##

**Employee attrition, or the rate at which employees leave a company, is a critical metric for businesses. High attrition rates can signal 
issues within an organization, such as employee dissatisfaction, lack of career growth opportunities, or inadequate compensation. 
Understanding and addressing the factors driving attrition can help a company retain its talent, reduce recruitment and training costs, 
and maintain a productive workforce.**

## OBJECTIVE 

**The purpose of this data analysis report is to project employee attrition by examining patterns and trends within the company's workforce data. 
Through this analysis, we aim to identify factors contributing to attrition, predict future attrition rates, and suggest actionable recommendations 
to mitigate high turnover.**

**The analysis involves reviewing historical employee data, such as:**

* **Demographics: Age, gender, marital status,  etc.**

* **Employment Factors: **Department, tenure, salary, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and career growth opportunities.**

* **Exit Interviews and Surveys: **Insights into reasons for leaving, feedback on company culture, and employee engagement.**


## METHOODLOGY

1. **Data Collection: We will gather internal HR data, including demographic information, job history, salary details, and exit interview responses.**


2. **Data Preprocessing: This involves cleaning the data to address inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers that could skew the analysis.**


3. * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will uncover trends and patterns in the dataset. Visualization tools, such as bar charts,
4. histograms, and scatter plots, will help us understand correlations between attrition and various factors.**


5. * **Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests,
6.  we will build models to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving.**


7. **Validation and Testing: We’ll split the dataset into training and test sets to validate model accuracy and ensure reliable predictions.**



# #EXPECTED OUTCOME

**The report will deliver insights on:**

* **Attrition Drivers: Factors like low job satisfaction, long working hours, poor management, or limited growth opportunities.

**Employee Segments at Risk: Identifying high-risk groups based on demographics, job roles, or tenure.**

* Attrition Rate Forecast: **A projection of future attrition rates if current trends continue.**

* **Recommendations: **Strategies for HR to improve employee retention, such as policy changes, enhanced**
** training programs, and better compensation packages.**


## Benefits of Analysis

* **With a clear understanding of attrition patterns, the company can:**

* **Optimize Talent Management: Proactively address factors leading to turnover.**

* **Enhance Employee Engagement: **Develop initiatives that improve job satisfaction and employee loyalty.**

* C**ost Savings: Lower recruitment, hiring, and training costs by retaining more employees.**

 Strategic Planning: **Use attrition forecasts to plan workforce needs and ensure business continuity.**


**This data-driven approach to understanding and managing employee attrition will help the company retain key 
talent, foster a positive work environment, and support long-term growth.**

## DATA DESCRIPTION
